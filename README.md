# python-GCP-pubsub-bq

This is my first learning project to use Python with Google Cloud Platform's Pub/Sub and BigQuery Database.

The idea here is to read Stock prices of some of the popular companies at reglar intervals, Format them and Send them to a Pub/Sub Topic.
Then Subscribe to the Topic, Pull from there and Write it to a Google Big Query Table.

It has no functional relevance and is just for study purpose.
